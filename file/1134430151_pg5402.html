          DICTIONARY
             OF
BUCKISH SLANG, UNIVERSITY WIT,
            AND
     PICKPOCKET ELOQUENCE.</h5>

<h4 id="id00004" style="margin-top: 2em">UNABRIDGED FROM THE ORIGINAL 1811 EDITION WITH A FOREWORD BY
ROBERT CROMIE</h4>

<h5 id="id00005">COMPILED ORIGINALLY BY CAPTAIN GROSE.</h5>

<h5 id="id00006">AND NOW CONSIDERABLY ALTERED AND ENLARGED, WITH THE MODERN
CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS, BY A MEMBER OF THE WHIP CLUB.</h5>

<h5 id="id00007">ASSISTED BY HELL-FIRE DICK, AND JAMES GORDON,
ESQRS. OF CAMBRIDGE; AND WILLIAM SOAMES, ESQ. OF
THE HON. SOCIETY OF NEWMAN'S HOTEL.</h5>

<h1 id="id00008" style="margin-top: 5em">PREFACE.</h1>

<p id="id00009">The merit of Captain Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue has
been long and universally acknowledged. But its circulation was
confined almost exclusively to the lower orders of society: he
was not aware, at the time of its compilation, that our young men
of fashion would at no very distant period be as distinguished
for the vulgarity of their jargon as the inhabitants of Newgate;
and he therefore conceived it superfluous to incorporate with his
work the few examples of fashionable slang that might occur to
his observation.</p>

<p id="id00010">But our Jehus of rank have a phraseology not less peculiar to
themselves, than the disciples of Barrington: for the uninitiated
to understand their modes of expression, is as impossible as for
a Buxton to construe the Greek Testament. To sport an Upper
Benjamin, and to swear with a good grace, are qualifications
easily attainable by their cockney imitators; but without the aid
of our additional definitions, neither the cits of Fish-street,
nor the boors of Brentford would be able to attain the language
of whippism. We trust, therefore, that the whole tribe of
second-rate Bang Ups, will feel grateful for our endeavour to render
this part of the work as complete as possible. By an occasional
reference to our pages, they may be initiated into all the
peculiarities of language by which the man of spirit is
distinguished from the man of worth. They may now talk bawdy
before their papas, without the fear of detection, and abuse
their less spirited companions, who prefer a good dinner at home
to a glorious UP-SHOT in the highway, without the hazard of a
cudgelling.</p>

<p id="id00011">But we claim not merely the praise of gratifying curiosity, or
affording assistance to the ambitious; we are very sure that the
moral influence of the Lexicon Balatronicum will be more certain
and extensive than that of any methodist sermon that has ever
been delivered within the bills of mortality. We need not descant
on the dangerous impressions that are made on the female mind, by
the remarks that fall incidentally from the lips of the brothers
or servants of a family; and we have before observed, that
improper topics can with our assistance be discussed, even before
the ladies, without raising a blush on the cheek of modesty. It
is impossible that a female should understand the meaning of
TWIDDLE DIDDLES, or rise from table at the mention of BUCKINGER'S
BOOT. Besides, Pope assures us, that "VICE TO BE HATED NEEDS BUT
TO BE SEEN;" in this volume it cannot be denied, that she is seen
very plainly; and a love of virtue is, therefore, the necessary
result of perusing it.</p>

<p id="id00012">The propriety of introducing the UNIVERSITY SLANG will be readily
admitted; it is not less curious than that of the College in the
Old
Bailey, and is less generally understood. When the number and
accuracy of our additions are compared with the price of the
volume, we have no doubt that its editors will meet with the
encouragement that is due to learning, modesty, and virtue.</p>

  the whole is thrown a tarpaulin, or old sail: this is
  kept tight by two persons, who are to represent the king
  and queen of a foreign country, and are seated on the
  stools. The person intended to be ducked plays the Ambassador,
  and after repeating a ridiculous speech dictated
  to him, is led in great form up to the throne, and seated
  between the king and queen, who rising suddenly as soon
  as he is seated, he falls backwards into the tub of water.</p>

  Anthony's pig; to follow close at one's heels. St. Anthony
  the hermit was a swineherd, and is always represented
  with a swine's bell and a pig. Some derive this saying
  from a privilege enjoyed by the friars of certain convents
  in England and France (sons of St. Anthony), whose swine
  were permitted to feed in the streets. These swine would
  follow any one having greens or other provisions, till they
  obtained some of them; and it was in those days considered

  their degree.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00073" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">APOTHECARY. To talk like an apothecary; to use hard or
  gallipot words: from the assumed gravity and affectation
  of knowledge generally put on by the gentlemen of this
  profession, who are commonly as superficial in their
  learning as they are pedantic in their language.</p>

<p id="id00074">APOTHECARY'S BILL. A long bill.</p>

  on every one they can, and then to salute them with
  the title of April Fool. This is also practised in
  Scotland under the title of Hunting the Gowke.</p>

<p id="id00080" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">APRON STRING HOLD. An estate held by a man during

  Lord! how that horse laughs! A by-stander telling him
  that noise was called NEIGHING, the next morning, when
  the cock crowed, the citizen to shew he had not forgot
  what was told him, cried out, Do you hear how the COCK

  wanton; or a nestle cock, delicately bred and brought up, so
  as, when arrived a man's estate, to be unable to bear the least
  hardship. Whatever may be the origin of this appellation, we

  which consists of a number of men laid all along on their
  backs, one after another, that is, head to foot; he next
  puts in the ribs or knees, by making a number of men sit
  feet to feet, at right angles to, and on each side of, the
  keel: he now fixing on the person intended to be the object
  of the joke, observes he is a fierce-looking fellow,
  and fit for the lion; he accordingly places him at the head,
  his arms being held or locked in by the two persons next
  to him, representing the ribs. After several other
  dispositions, the builder delivers over the galley to the
  contractor as complete: but he, among other faults and

  or one of his assistants, runs to the head, and dipping a

<p id="id01739" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">GYPSIES. A set of vagrants, who, to the great disgrace of
  our police, are suffered to wander about the country.
  They pretend that they derive their origin from the
  ancient Egyptians, who were famous for their knowledge
  in astronomy and other sciences; and, under the pretence
  of fortune-telling, find means to rob or defraud the ignorant
  and superstitious. To colour their impostures, they
  artificially discolour their faces, and speak a kind of
  gibberish peculiar to themselves. They rove up and down the
  country in large companies, to the great terror of the
  farmers, from whose geese, turkeys, and fowls, they take very
  considerable contributions.</p>

<p id="id01740" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  When a fresh recruit is admitted into the fraternity, he is to
   take the following oath, administered by the principal
   maunder, after going through the annexed forms:</p>

<p id="id01741" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  First, a new name is given him by which he is ever after to
   be called; then standing up in the middle of the assembly,
   and directing his face to the dimber damber, or principal
   man of the gang, he repeats the following oath, which is
   dictated to him by some experienced member of the fraternity:</p>

<p id="id01742" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I, Crank Cuffin, do swear to be a true brother, and that I will
   in all things obey the commands of the great tawney
   prince, and keep his counsel and not divulge the secrets of
   my brethren.</p>

<p id="id01743" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I will never leave nor forsake the company, but observe and
   keep all the times of appointment, either by day or by
   night, in every place whatever.</p>

<p id="id01744" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I will not teach any one to cant, nor will I disclose any of
   our mysteries to them.</p>

<p id="id01745" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I will take my prince's part against all that shall oppose him,
   or any of us, according to the utmost of my ability; nor
   will I suffer him, or any one belongiug to us, to be abused
   by any strange abrams, rufflers, hookers, pailliards,
   swaddlers, Irish toyles, swigmen, whip jacks, jarkmen,
   bawdy baskets, dommerars, clapper dogeons, patricoes,
   or curtals; but will defend him, or them, as much as I
   can, against all other outliers whatever. I will not conceal
   aught I win out of libkins or from the ruffmans, but
   will preserve it for the use of the company. Lastly, I
   will cleave to my doxy wap stiffly, and will bring her
   duds, marjery praters, goblers, grunting cheats, or tibs
   of the buttery, or any thing else I can come at, as
   winnings for her weppings.</p>

<p id="id01746" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The canters have, it seems, a tradition, that from the three
   first articles of this oath, the first founders of a certain
   boastful, worshipful fraternity (who pretend to derive their
   origin from the earliest times) borrowed both the hint and
   form of their establishment; and that their pretended
   derivation from the first Adam is a forgery, it being only
   from the first Adam Tiler: see ADAM TILER. At the
   admission of a new brother, a general stock is raised for
   booze, or drink, to make themselves merry on the occasion.
   As for peckage or eatables, they can procure without
   money; for while some are sent to break the ruffmans,
   or woods and bushes, for firing, others are detached to
   filch geese, chickens, hens, ducks (or mallards), and pigs.
   Their morts are their butchers, who presently make
   bloody work with what living things are brought them; and
   having made holes in the ground under some remote hedge
   in an obscure place, they make a fire and boil or broil their
   food; and when it is enough, fall to work tooth and nail:
   and having eaten more like beasts than men, they drink
   more like swine than human creatures, entertaining one
   another all the time with songs in the canting dialect.</p>

<p id="id01747" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  As they live, so they lie, together promiscuously, and know
   not how to claim a property either in their goods or children:
   and this general interest ties them more firmly together
   than if all their rags were twisted into ropes, to bind
   them indissolubly from a separation; which detestable
   union is farther consolidated by the above oath.</p>

<p id="id01748" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  They stroll up and down all summer-time in droves, and
   Dexterously pick pockets, while they are telling of fortunes;
   and the money, rings, silver thirribles, &amp;c. which they
   get, are instantly conveyed from one hand to another,
   till the remotest person of the gang (who is not suspected
   because they come not near the person robbed) gets possession
   of it; so that, in the strictest search, it is impossible to
   recover it; while the wretches with imprecations,
   oaths, and protestations, disclaim the thievery.</p>

<p id="id01749" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  That by which they are said to get the most money, is,
   when young gentlewomen of good families and reputation
   have happened to be with child before marriage, a round
   sum is often bestowed among the gypsies, for some one
   mort to take the child; and as that is never heard of
   more by the true mother and family, so the disgrace is
   kept concealed from the world; and, if the child lives, it
   never knows its parents.</p>

  according to the vulgar tradition, was thus allotted: one
  shilling for the executioner, and three halfpence for the
  rope,—N. B. This refers to former times; the hangmen of the
  present day having, like other artificers, raised their prices.
  The true state of this matter is, that a Scottish mark was
  the fee allowed for an execution, and the value of that
  piece was settled by a proclamation of James I. at thirteen
  pence halfpenny.</p>

  and march from thence in procession, through that town
  and Greenwich, to Charlton, with horns of different kinds
  upon their heads; and at the fair there are sold rams
  horns, and every sort of toy made of horn; even the gingerbread
  figures have horns, The vulgar tradition gives the
  following history of the origin of this fair; King John,
  or some other of our ancient kings, being at the palace of
  Eltham, in this neighbourhood, and having been out a
  hunting one day, rambled from his company to this place,
  then a mean hamlet; when entering a cottage to inquire
  his way, he was struck with the beauty of the mistress,
  whom he found alone; and having prevailed over her
  modesty, the husband returning suddenly, surprised them
  together; and threatening to kill them both, the king was
  obliged to discover himself, and to compound for his safety
  by a purse of gold, and a grant of the land from this
  place to Cuckold's Point, besides making the husband
  master of the hamlet. It is added that, in memory of this
  grant, and the occasion of it, this fair was established, for
  the sale of horns, and all sorts of goods made with that

  from Stow, gives the following account of this Wotton:
  This man was a gentleman born, and sometime a merchant
  of good credit, but fallen by time into decay: he kept
  an alehouse near Smart's Key, near Billingsgate,
  afterwards for some misdemeanor put down. He reared up a
  new trade of life, and in the same house he procured all
  the cut-purses about the city, to repair to his house;
  there was a school-house set up to learn young boys to
  cut purses: two devices were hung up; one was a pocket,
  and another was a purse; the pocket had in it certain
  counters, and was hung about with hawks bells, and over
  the top did hang a little sacring bell. The purse had
  silver in it; and he that could take out a counter,
  without noise of any of the bells, was adjudged a
  judicial NYPPER: according to their terms of art, a
  FOYSTER was a pick-pocket; a NYPPER was a pick purse,
  or cut-purse.</p>

  This appellation is said to have originated from the

  the non-conformists were extremely severe. They
  sometimes met in very obscure places: and there is a tradition
  that one of their congregations were assembled in a barn,
  the rendezvous of beggars and other vagrants, where the
  preacher, for want of a ladder or tub, was suspended in
  a sack fixed to the beam. His discourse that day being
  on the last judgment, he particularly attempted to describe
  the terrors of the wicked at the sounding of the trumpet,
  on which a trumpeter to a puppet-show, who had taken
  refuge in that barn, and lay hid under the straw, sounded
  a charge. The congregation, struck with the utmost
  consternation, fled in an instant from the place, leaving
  their affrighted teacher to shift for himself. The effects
  of his terror are said to have appeared at the bottom of
  the sack, and to have occasioned that opprobrious appellation

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily

you share it without charge with others.

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO

</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
